  <h1>MutePhoto Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to MutePhoto (referred to as “the App,” “we,” or “MutePhoto”). We value your privacy and data security. This document explains how we collect, use, store, disclose, and protect the personal and non-personal information you provide when using MutePhoto. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the App.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and Contact Information:</strong> such as your email address if you create an account or contact us (e.g., for support or billing receipts).</li>
      <li><strong>Content Data:</strong> photos, videos, and related metadata (such as timestamps or location tags, unless removed by you upon upload) that you import, upload, or store in the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment and Subscription Information:</strong> purchase records (via the Apple App Store) and necessary data to verify subscription status. We do not collect credit card numbers directly; all payments are processed through Apple’s system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> device type, operating system version, device identifiers (anonymous or hashed), app version, crash logs, usage behavior (e.g., feature usage frequency), and performance data.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Data:</strong> aggregated or anonymized data to help us improve product performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <p>If you use MutePhoto through third-party services (such as social login, cloud storage, or other integrated services), we may receive necessary information from these providers. We only process such data where required or with your consent.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the App’s core functions (e.g., encrypted storage, album access, photo management).</li>
      <li>To process payments, subscriptions, and verify subscription status (via Apple’s App Store system).</li>
      <li>To improve the App, fix errors, analyze usage, and enhance performance.</li>
      <li>To send you service-related notifications, billing information, or support responses (and, if you consent, promotional communications).</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent, and address fraud, misuse, or security incidents.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Storage, Encryption, and Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss. Sensitive data (such as private photos) stored on your device or transmitted through the App may be encrypted. We also recommend enabling device-level encryption and lock screen security provided by your operating system.</p>
    <p>No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We regularly review and update our security practices.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We may engage third-party providers (e.g., analytics, cloud backup, crash logging, customer support, in-app purchase validation, or hosting services) to support the App’s functionality. These providers may process or access certain data on our behalf. We review third parties to ensure they comply with applicable data protection obligations.</p>
    <p>Examples may include analytics platforms, crash monitoring tools, email providers, and cloud storage services. For a current list of service providers, please contact us using the details below.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Payments, Subscriptions, and Auto-Renewals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All payments and subscriptions are handled through the Apple App Store. Apple processes your payment information; we do not directly collect or store credit card details.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions automatically renew according to the period you select, unless you cancel through your Apple ID account settings.</li>
      <li>We may use App Store receipts to verify subscription status and enable features accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you request account deletion, we will delete or anonymize most personal data within a reasonable timeframe, though backups may persist longer.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
